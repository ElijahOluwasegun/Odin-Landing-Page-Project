# Odin-Landing-Page-Project

This is a Landing Page I will be creating from the designs The Odin Project will be providing me. In this, I will be demonstrating my HTML, CSS skills. Additionally, I will also be showcasing my git skills - including good commit messaging.

Thank you, I hope you find my project worth looking into.
